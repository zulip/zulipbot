**Note:** Depending on your [notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications), granting you the permission in GitHub's model that lets you be assigned issues by Zulipbot might have had the side effect of making you a "watcher" on this repository, which means that you'll get notifications for every issue and pull request in this repository; for a large repository like [zulip/zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip), that mean receiving more than 100 emails per day. If you don't want to receive notifications unless you're actually involved with the issue (which is usually the right choice for large projects), you should [unwatch this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/unwatching-repositories/).
