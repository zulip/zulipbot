Hello @[author], it seems like you have referenced an issue in your comments, but have not referenced that issue in your commit message(s). When you reference the issue in the commit message, it closes the issue for Zulip maintainers once your commit is merged.

Use `git commit --amend` to amend your commit message with `"Fixes #[issue number]"`.
