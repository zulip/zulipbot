Congratulations, @[commenter], you've successfully claimed your first issue! Contributing to Open Data Kit will (hopefully) be a fun and rewarding experience, and I'm here to help get you off to a good start.

First things first:
* Please read the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md in this repo. Those two documents have much of what you need to get started. 
* Join the [ODK developer Slack](http://slack.opendatakit.org/) to get help, chat about this issue, and meet the other developers.
* Sign up and introduce yourself on the [ODK community forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org/) to meet the broader ODK community.

See you on the other side (that is, the pull request side)!
