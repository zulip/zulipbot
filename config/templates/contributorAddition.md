Welcome to Zulip, @{commenter}! To get started, please take the following three steps **in order**:

1. Complete all the steps in the [Your first codebase contribution](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html#your-first-codebase-contribution) section of the [Zulip contributor guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html) up to "Claiming an issue".
2. Post a comment here describing your plan for how to approach this issue. Before you claim an issue, you should be confident that you will be able to tackle it effectively.
3. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository at https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/invitations. To avoid filling your inbox, we recommend [unwatching this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/unwatching-repositories/).

The issue will be assigned to you when all three steps have been completed.

If someone else claims this issue while you're working through the checklist, no worries! You can contribute by providing feedback on their pull request. If you’ve made good progress in understanding part of the codebase, you can also find another “help wanted” issue in the same area to work on.
