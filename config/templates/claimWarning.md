Hello @{commenter}!

You have attempted to claim an issue {state} the {labelGrammar} {list}. It seems like you are new to Zulip, so we suggest working on an issue with the [help wanted](https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label first. We also recommend reading our [guide for new contributors](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) before getting started.

To claim this issue anyway, comment on this issue again with the command `@{username} claim --force`.
