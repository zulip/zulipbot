[@zulipbot](https://github.com/zulipbot) is a GitHub workflow bot for the
[Zulip organization](https://zulip.org) and its repositories. Written in
Node.js, the bot handles issues in the repository in order to create a
better workflow for Zulip contributors.

**@zulipbot** is currently deployed on all repositories of the [Zulip
organization](https://zulip.org).

## Usage

* **Claim an issue** — Comment `@zulipbot claim` on the issue you want
to claim; **@zulipbot** will assign you to the issue and label the issue as
**in progress**.

    If you're a new contributor, **@zulipbot** will give you read-only
    collaborator access to the repository and leave a welcome message on the
    issue you claimed.

    You can also claim an issue that you've opened by including
    "**@zulipbot** claim" in the body of your issue.

    If you accidentally claim an issue you didn't want to claim, comment
    `@zulipbot abandon` to abandon an issue.

* **Label your issues** — Add appropriate labels to issues that you opened by
including`@zulipbot label` in an issue comment or the body of your issue
followed by the desired labels enclosed within double quotes (`""`).

    For example, to add the **bug** and **help wanted** labels to your
    issue, comment or include `@zulipbot label "bug" "help wanted"` in the
    issue body.

    You'll receive an error message if you try to add any labels to your issue
    that don't exist in your repository.

    If you accidentally added the wrong labels, you can remove them by commenting
    `@zulipbot remove` followed by the desired labels enclosed with double quotes
    (`""`).
