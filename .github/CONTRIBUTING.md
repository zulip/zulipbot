### Installation

1. Open your command line interface (CLI).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot.git
  ```

3. Switch to the local copy of this repository.

  ```sh
  $ cd ~/path-to-repo/zulipbot
  ```

4. Install the necessary node packages and dependencies.

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```

5. Use the [smee.io](https://smee.io/) CLI to redirect GitHub webhook payloads
   to your locally running application.

  ```sh
  $ smee -u https://smee.io/yourcustomurl -P /github -p 8080
  ```

6. Create a [GitHub user
   account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)
   and a [GitHub
   App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/)
   to test with.
  * See
    [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot/wiki/Configuration#authentication)
    to check how to authenticate your user account.
  * The **Webhook URL** in your GitHub App settings should be
    `https://smee.io/yourcustomurl`.

7. Run the bot to ensure that your environment was configured correctly.

  ```sh
  $ npm start
  ```

If you encounter any problems during installation, let us know on the [zulipbot
chat](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/zulipbot) and we can help you out!

## Making changes

1. Create a separate feature branch from the `master` branch for the changes you
   plan to make.

2. Commit your changes, following Zulip's [commit discipline
   practice](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/version-control.html#commit-discipline).

3. Check if your changes and commits pass all tests:

  ```sh
  $ npm test
  ```

  Modify your commits accordingly if your changes don't pass all tests.

4. Fetch and rebase your changes against `upstream`:

  ```sh
  $ git fetch upstream
  ```

  Fix merge conflicts if necessary.

5. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

  ```sh
  $ git push origin feature-branch-name
  ```

  You may need to append `+` before your feature branch name if you failed to
  push some refs.

6. Create a [pull
   request](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/pull-requests.html#create-a-pull-request)
   for the changes you made.

  * The **base fork** should be `zulip/zulipbot`.

  * The **base** should be `master`.

  * The **head fork** should be the name of your fork (ex: `octocat/zulipbot`).

  * The **compare** branch should be the name of your feature branch.

7. One of the project maintainers will review your pull request and merge it
   once the pull request's Travis builds pass and any concerns about your pull
   request are settled.

### Testing
**zulipbot** is currently manually tested on private repositories and user
accounts while a test suite is being established. Webhook payloads can be
delivered to a locally running application using [Smee](https://smee.io/).

Our current test suite consists of [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) for
continuous integration, and we review code quality and consistency with the
[Eslint](https://eslint.org) linter.
